In this example, we first create a fenced code block using Markdown syntax to display the `npm run dev` command in a code format.

Next, we create a button element using HTML syntax and add an `onclick` attribute to it that calls a JavaScript function called `copyToClipboard` when clicked.

The `copyToClipboard` function uses the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` method to write the command text to the clipboard. If the text is successfully copied, an alert message is displayed to confirm the action. Otherwise, an error message is logged to the console.

You can customize the button styles as needed by adding CSS styles to your `README.md` file. Note that the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` method may not work in some older browsers.
